## About Me
Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Kentucky. See my homepage at https://michaelmorrow.me and my LinkedIn at [in/michaelhmorrow98](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhmorrow98/).

## Completed Projects

- [OIGroebnerBases](https://github.com/morrowmh/OIGroebnerBases), a Macaulay2 package for computation in OI-modules over Noetherian polynomial OI-algebras. Available as part of the official [Macaulay2](https://www.macaulay2.com/) release as of version [1.23](https://www.macaulay2.com/doc/Macaulay2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_changes_cm_sp1.23.html).

## Current Projects

- [FIResolutions](https://github.com/morrowmh/FIResolutions), a Macaulay2 package for computing free FI-resolutions over Noetherian polynomial FI-algebras.
